# Christos Maragkoudakis

**LLM Practitioner** • Athens, Greece

Started in electrical engineering before finding my path in Economics—kept the technical instincts, added the analytical framework. I build what I study: working LLM codebases, not just theory.

### Currently Building

**[agent-athens](https://github.com/chrimar3/agent_athens)** — Cultural events platform for Athens designed for AI answer engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude) rather than traditional SEO. Live prototype, ~315 pages, automated daily updates.

### Recent Work

- **Media Bias Detection System** — Claude API processing 230+ Greek media articles for information asymmetry analysis. Automated NLP pipeline. (Thesis, Grade: 9/10)
- **Hydrogen Energy Research** — Economic transition analysis with Monte Carlo simulations for commissioned energy sector research. (9.5/10 evaluation)

### Stack

Python • TypeScript • Claude API • OpenAI API • Bun • Next.js • SQLite
